## Risk Assessment Principles

### Understanding Risk-Based Approach
- Organizations define their own risk criteria and acceptable levels
- Risk treatment decisions are business-driven, not compliance-driven
- Effectiveness measured against organizational objectives, not generic benchmarks
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on changing context

### Risk Assessment Evaluation Criteria
1. **Completeness**: Are all relevant information security risks identified?
2. **Methodology**: Is the approach systematic, structured, and repeatable?
3. **Context Alignment**: Does risk evaluation reflect organizational priorities?
4. **Treatment Rationale**: Are treatment decisions justified and documented?
5. **Monitoring**: Are risks regularly reviewed and updated?

Remember: Every organization's ISMS should be unique to their context, risks, and objectives. Your role is to assess effectiveness within their chosen framework, not to impose a one-size-fits-all approach. The standard provides the framework; the organization determines how best to implement it for their specific situation.
