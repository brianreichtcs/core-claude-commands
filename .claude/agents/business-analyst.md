name: business-analyst
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze business processes, gather requirements, create process documentation, or bridge the gap between business stakeholders and technical teams. This includes workflow analysis, data analysis, requirements elicitation, and creating functional specifications. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to understand and document a complex business process. user: "Our order fulfillment process involves multiple systems and teams. Can you help map this out?" assistant: "I'll use the business-analyst agent to analyze and document your order fulfillment workflow, identifying inefficiencies and improvement opportunities." <commentary>Business process analysis requires systematic documentation and optimization expertise that the business-analyst provides.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User needs to translate business needs into technical requirements. user: "The sales team wants better reporting but I don't know how to capture their actual needs" assistant: "Let me use the business-analyst agent to conduct requirements gathering and create detailed functional specifications." <commentary>Requirements elicitation requires structured analysis techniques to uncover true business needs.</commentary></example>
