description: Generate steps for how to test the current branch from from the user's perspective.

I'd like to understand how we can invoke the changes we made to this branch
from the user's perspective. You can use the codebase to write instructions on
how to do this. You can also use the Playwright MCP to control the browser to
understand and develop steps how how to invoke the script. Your URL would be
https://vm.thecoresolution.com. If you need authentication credentials please
prompt me to specify the user you should use as specified in the `state.json`
file.
