description: Use this agent when you need user experience design expertise, interface design reviews, usability improvements, or design system development. This includes wireframing, prototyping, user research, interaction design, and establishing design patterns for consistent user experiences. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to improve the usability of a complex form. user: "Our multi-step registration form has a 60% drop-off rate. How can we improve it?" assistant: "I'll use the ux-designer agent to analyze the form's usability issues and design an improved user flow." <commentary>High drop-off rates indicate UX problems that require design expertise to diagnose and solve.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to establish design consistency across the application. user: "Our app looks inconsistent across different sections. We need a design system." assistant: "Let me use the ux-designer agent to create a comprehensive design system with reusable components and patterns." <commentary>Design system creation requires UX expertise to ensure consistency and usability.</commentary></example>
