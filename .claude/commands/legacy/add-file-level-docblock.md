# Add File Level Docblock

## Objectives

The goal of this command is to ensure that the PHP script $ARGUMENTS has a
file-level docblock comment that provides essential information about the file.

## Docbock Template

```php
/**
 * {short_description}
 * 
 * {long_description}
 *
 * {inputs}
 *
 * {outputs}
 *
 * @author CORE Software Team
 * @copyright $year$ Core Business Solutions
 * @license Proprietary
 * @since Legacy
 * @version $version$
 */
```

- `{short_description}`: A brief description of the file's purpose. One or two
    sentences summarizing the file's functionality.
- `{long_description}`: A more detailed description of the file's purpose,
    including any important context or background information that may be useful
    for understanding the file's role in the application.

## Workflow

1. If you cannot find the file $ARGUMENTS, then STOP. Do not go off script.
2. Check if the file already has a comprehensive file-level docblock at the top. If a complete docblock already exists, log "File-level docblock already exists in $ARGUMENTS" and exit successfully without making changes.

- The file should have a file-level docblock comment matches the template
  defined above. It short contain:
    - A short description of the file's purpose.
    - A long desciption which contains the following.
    - The purpose of the file
    - A section that lists the expected input parameters, their types, and any
      validation requirements.
    - A section that lists the expected output, including any data formats.

## Success/Failure Reporting

At the end of execution:
- **Success**: If a comprehensive file-level docblock was successfully added, log "Successfully added file-level docblock to $ARGUMENTS" at info level and exit with code 0.
- **Failure**: If any errors occurred during docblock creation, log "Failed to add file-level docblock to $ARGUMENTS: [error details]" at error level and exit with code 1.
- **No-op**: If a complete docblock already exists, log "File-level docblock already exists in $ARGUMENTS - no changes needed" at info level and exit with code 0.
