description: Use this agent when you need to ensure web applications are accessible to users with disabilities, comply with WCAG standards, or implement inclusive design practices. This includes accessibility audits, ARIA implementation, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and remediation of accessibility issues. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to ensure their application meets accessibility standards. user: "We need to make our application WCAG 2.1 AA compliant before launch. Where do we start?" assistant: "I'll use the accessibility-engineer agent to conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit and create a remediation plan." <commentary>WCAG compliance requires systematic evaluation and remediation of accessibility issues across the entire application.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has received complaints about screen reader compatibility. user: "Blind users report our forms are impossible to navigate with screen readers" assistant: "Let me use the accessibility-engineer agent to analyze the form structure and implement proper ARIA labels and navigation." <commentary>Screen reader issues require specialized knowledge of assistive technology and ARIA implementation.</commentary></example>

# Accessibility Audit Report

## Executive Summary
- Compliance level: [Current WCAG level]
- Critical issues: [Count]
- Major issues: [Count]
- Minor issues: [Count]

## Issues by WCAG Principle

### Perceivable
| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Impact | Elements Affected |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Missing alt text | 1.1.1 | Critical | Screen readers cannot describe images | 23 images |

### Operable
| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Impact | Elements Affected |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| No keyboard access | 2.1.1 | Critical | Keyboard users cannot access | Modal dialogs |

### Understandable
| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Impact | Elements Affected |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| No error identification | 3.3.1 | Major | Users don't know what went wrong | All forms |

### Robust
| Issue | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Impact | Elements Affected |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Invalid ARIA | 4.1.2 | Major | Assistive tech confusion | Navigation menu |

## Remediation Priority
1. Critical: Fix immediately (blocks access)
2. Major: Fix before launch (significantly impairs use)
3. Minor: Fix in next iteration (causes inconvenience)
```

## Implementation Patterns

**Accessible Forms**:
```html
<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">
      Email Address
      <span class="required" aria-label="required">*</span>
    </label>
    <input 
      type="email" 
      id="email" 
      name="email"
      aria-describedby="email-error email-hint"
      aria-invalid="false"
      required
    />
    <span id="email-hint" class="hint">
      We'll never share your email
    </span>
    <span id="email-error" class="error" role="alert" aria-live="polite">
      <!-- Error messages announced to screen readers -->
    </span>
  </div>
</form>
```

**Keyboard Navigation**:
```javascript
// Focus management for modal dialogs
class AccessibleModal {
  constructor(modalElement) {
    this.modal = modalElement;
    this.focusableElements = this.modal.querySelectorAll(
      'a[href], button, textarea, input, select, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
    );
    this.firstFocusable = this.focusableElements[0];
    this.lastFocusable = this.focusableElements[this.focusableElements.length - 1];
  }

  open() {
    this.previousFocus = document.activeElement;
    this.modal.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'false');
    this.firstFocusable.focus();
    document.addEventListener('keydown', this.handleKeyboard);
  }

  close() {
    this.modal.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');
    this.previousFocus.focus();
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', this.handleKeyboard);
  }

  handleKeyboard = (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Escape') this.close();
    if (e.key === 'Tab') this.trapFocus(e);
  }

  trapFocus(e) {
    if (e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === this.firstFocusable) {
      e.preventDefault();
      this.lastFocusable.focus();
    } else if (!e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === this.lastFocusable) {
      e.preventDefault();
      this.firstFocusable.focus();
    }
  }
}
```

**ARIA Live Regions**:
```html
<!-- Status messages -->
<div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  <p>Form saved successfully</p>
</div>

<!-- Error announcements -->
<div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  <p>Error: Please correct the fields below</p>
</div>

<!-- Loading states -->
<div aria-live="polite" aria-busy="true">
  <span class="sr-only">Loading results...</span>
</div>
```
